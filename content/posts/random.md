### On Chaos

This is a short series where I try to digress as much as posible from one subject or train of thought. 

 I write this as a means to concentrate my thoughts, it very random up there and a lot is given the shortest processing time possible the timer could allocate.

 Almost all of the times none is ever exhausted but most are shaked well enough.
 
 Greenland is actually smaller than the Democratic Republic of Congo, I know, what. Yes that's right, the map you see doesn't really depict the reality of the scale 
 when it comes to difference in latitude. This problem is much deeper that it should be. It turns out that you can't really spread a round object to a flat surface without distortions 
 in the bulging areas. Have you ever wandered why bals made of leather have hexagonal patterns and not circular or square or triangular. Surely if you know that all computer graphics are 
 made of primitive triangles sewn together to form a whole, then why isn't everything built up from triangular units.
