Welcome to my blog and thanks for stopping by. This is where I write about random educative and entertaining content, related to phylosophy, psychology, programming, security and science.

I'm certainly not the most qualified in the above mentioned fields but those are the ones that are the most fascinating to me and I want to share, my research on the same here.

This is my way of reaching an audience, free from algorithmic manipulation, mass psychology and tracking. If you are here then that means you want to be here.
