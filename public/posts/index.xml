      <description>On Chaos This is a short series where I try to digress as much as posible from one subject or train of thought.
I write this as a means to concentrate my thoughts, it very random up there and a lot is given the shortest processing time possible the timer could allocate.
Almost all of the times none is ever exhausted but most are shaked well enough.

      <description>Welcome to my blog and thanks for stopping by. This is where I write about random educative and entertaining content, related to phylosophy, psychology, programming, security and science.
I&amp;rsquo;m certainly not the most qualified in the above mentioned fields but those are the ones that are the most fascinating to me and I want to share, my research on the same here.
This is my way of reaching an audience, free from algorithmic manipulation, mass psychology and tracking.</description>
