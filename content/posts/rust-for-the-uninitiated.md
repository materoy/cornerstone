# Rust for the Uninitiated

You might have heard about a certain hypetrain, sorry "cult" called rust. No? Great allow me to introduce you to a very skill coveted form of instruction called The Rust Programming Language. Spoiler alert, it wasn't named after Fe2O3 but a fungi, I don't know either. Anyway Rust has been the language that was voted to most loved language 8 years consecutively at the time of this writting.
